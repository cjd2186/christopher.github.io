I am a graduate student at Columbia University (BA '24, MS '25), located in New York City.
I thrive when working in teams, love to collaborate, and I am a dedicated, passionate learner.
I enjoy learning new technologies and I am looking to work as a Software Developer and Machine Learning Engineer where I can learn and grow.
