I am currently a MS Student at Columbia Engineering, specializing in Machine Learning. I am a graduate of Columbia College, where I earned my BA with a major in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics. 
At Columbia, I have sharpened my skills in software development, NLP, Machine Learning, problem solving, mathematics, collaboration and strategic thinking.  

My interests include Weightlifting, Running, Swimming, Tennis and Baseball. Dependable and hardworking, I can pick up new skills and methods of working with ease while applying previously learnt skills efficiently.
